This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Build Scripts

This project includes automated build scripts for creating production-ready builds:

### Full Build Script (`build.sh`)

Comprehensive build script with environment setup, cleaning, dependency installation, and building:

```sh
# Build Android debug APK
./build.sh android debug

# Build Android release APK  
./build.sh android release

# Build iOS debug
./build.sh ios debug

# Build iOS release archive
./build.sh ios release

# Build both platforms (debug)
./build.sh both debug

# Build both platforms (release)
./build.sh both release
```

The build script automatically:
- Detects and sets up Android SDK environment
- Installs dependencies (npm packages and iOS pods)
- Cleans previous builds
- Handles environment validation

### Quick Development Script (`dev.sh`)

Faster builds for development without full setup:

```sh
# Quick Android debug build
./dev.sh android

# Quick iOS debug build
./dev.sh ios

# Start Metro bundler
./dev.sh metro
```

### Prerequisites

The build scripts will automatically check for and help set up:

**For Android:**
- Android Studio and Android SDK
- ANDROID_HOME environment variable
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

**For iOS (macOS only):**
- Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools
- CocoaPods

### Build Output Locations

- **Android Debug APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Android Release APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- **iOS Release Archive**: `ios/build/LemonadeStandApp.xcarchive`

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
